## Description
FrankyGo is the fourth chess engine I wrote. The first one was written in Java and had a JavaFX UI 
([Chessly](https://github.com/frankkopp/Chessly)) but did not support UCI. I was very inexperienced then, and the 
engine itself was not good. But I learned a lot and also liked developing the JavaFx part. I then rewrote it in Java 
again but as an UCI engine. This time the structure was much better thanks to many great chess engine developers I 
learned from. I also found out that my interest is in actual programming rather than building the "best" chess engine. 
Therefore, I used what I learned from other chess engines but tried to build mine in a clean and easy to understand way. 
This resulted in Franky 1.0
([Github](https://github.com/frankkopp/FrankyUCIChessEngine),
[CCRL](http://www.computerchess.org.uk/ccrl/404/cgi/engine_details.cgi?print=Details&each_game=1&eng=Franky%201.0%2064-bit#Franky_1_0_64-bit))
 
I then started to re-write it in C++ ([FrankyCPP](https://github.com/frankkopp/FrankyCPP)) and came quite far. But C++ 
(and its infrastructure) forced me to focus a lot on the language itself, and the surrounding tools. E.g. I learned a lot 
(too much?) about different compilers on different platforms, CMake, Boost, Google Test, etc. but it rather distracted 
me a lot from developing the chess engine itself. My time is limited so this was very annoying. 

Then I looked into [Go](https://golang.org/doc/). A completely new language compiled directly into machine code, 
platform independent, with a garbage collector and the promise to be as fast as C++/C. This was the motivation to start 
FrankyGo and Go kept its promises. Easy to learn, great tool set, no distraction from the code by the language and 
indeed fast. See below "Learning Go".

So FrankyGo is now a rather clean chess engine with a lot of potential. As mentioned above I do not claim to have 
invented any of algorithms and in fact I used many ideas from Stockfish, Crafty, Beowulf, etc. See "Credits" below.
 But I had a lot of fun developing it and I do hope to have more fun improving it in the future.

There is a small issue though - when developing a chess engine up to a certain level, testing starts to completely 
overshadow development. Every feature, every evaluation, every change needs lots of testing against KPIs, test suites, 
itself and real other engines. These tests are extremely time-consuming if they are to be meaningful. It needs thousands
 of games to reliably prove that a feature is an improvement, and these games need time. Too short thinking times make 
 the tests unreliable, especially for features which have increased effect in deeper searches. So several computers 
 doing tests at the same time is normal but also rather stressful :)

I will go on improving FrankyGo, and I'm happy to receive any feedback on my Go code but also of course on improving 
the engine itself.

A word on v1.0: I have implemented most major and common chess engine features, and the search itself is ok for now 
but can of course always be improved. There are many great ideas out there to make it even more effective. Evaluation 
in v1.0 is very basic. Only material and positional differences are counted. There are already some other evaluations 
implemented but deactivated as they need a lot of testing and tuning.

## Learning Go
Learning a new programming language is always most efficient within a real project.
As I have developed a chess engine in Java in the past and recently migrated it to C++ 
I thought that implementing a chess engine in Go is a great opportunity to learn the language. 

Chess engines offer a lot of different challenges in many aspects of a programming language. 
E.g. efficient data types and data structures, high performance code where even nanoseconds count, reading 
an opening book from files and creating a cache, bit twiddling, caches, recursion, unit testing, 
performance testing and optimization, logging, configurations, communication with other processes over 
pipes (UCI protocol), protocol implementation, etc. 
 
Especially the high performance code is something I'm interested in. The usual advice in programming 
is readability/understandability/maintainability of code is more important than performance and also, don't optimize 
too early, etc. In chess there are some recurring hot spots in the algorithms, which need extra attention 
on how they are implemented from the beginning, or they would be very slow. So a chess engine is a special 
case where efficiency and performance has a higher priority than in a typical application.  
 
E.g. a chess engine evaluates (calculating a numerical estimation of how "good" a position is) millions
of positions per second. For each position there are in average 35 moves to play. So to be able to search 
a million positions per second you need to generate at least the same amount of moves - usually many more 
as the alpha-beta search algorithm and other pruning techniques discard many positions before
they are even evaluated.   

For evaluating 1 million positions per second you have a time budget of 1.000 nanoseconds for creating 
the move that leads to this position, executing the move on your chess board data structure, evaluate 
the position, and the many other things you need to do so that your chess engines has at least some
playing strength. So you see, nanoseconds matter. 
  
As an example many years ago, during my first attempt at this in Java, it was quickly clear, that you can't model 
all of your data types as Java objects. Especially a chess move would be too expensive when implemented 
as a Java object as you need to create hundreds of millions in a very short time just to throw them away 
quickly. Object creation and garbage collection made this approach extremely slow. So one of the first "optimizations"
I did was to use a plain integer to represent a move. With bit twiddling I encoded the necessary data into the 
integer (from square, to square, move type, etc.). This is a very common approach in all the serious chess engines. 

This example also shows a big difference between Java, C++ and Go. In Java, when implementing a move as an int you
loose type checking by the compiler. In C++ you have typedef and in Go you have something similar to typdef. With a 
user defined primitive type the engine can use a plain int internally, but the compiler still can check the type 
correctness for moves. This is one of my most missed features in Java. 

What I already can say about Go is that implementing the chess engine in it was a joy and much easier done in Go than 
in Java or C++. Of course, I have experience building a chess engine now but mostly I noticed that in Go I could focus 
on the program itself and was rarely distracted by the "quirks" of the programming language although it was new to me. 
I'm aware I did not follow many of Go's best practices but rather "transferred" my existing code from C++/Java to it. 
Also, some aspects needed some re-thinking (e.g. no cyclic imports) but overall Go required much less language awareness
than for example C++ where I still find the compile-process unnecessary complicated (.h, cpp - declaration and 
definition, etc.) or Java where I can't have user defined primitive types.

In addition to this all the tools included and standardized in Go are extremely valuable. I had so many headaches in 
the past to find good free tools for Java and especially C++ for profiling, assembly code review, etc. comfortable on 
all platforms I'm using (Windows, Mac, Linux). 
Just look at this output from the Go pprof profiler which comes for free with Go:

## Installation
Windows build: 

    go build -o FrankyGo.exe github.com/frankkopp/FrankyGo/cmd/FrankyGo

    Run FrankyGo.exe    

Unix/Mac build: 

    go build -o FrankyGo github.com/frankkopp/FrankyGo/cmd/FrankyGo

    Run FrankyGo

## Usage
Typically, a UCI engine will be used with a UCI compatible chess interface like Arena, xboard, Fritz, etc.
Just configure a new engine in the UCI interface pointing to the executable of FrankyGo. If necessary use 
command line options to find config file, logs folder and opening books folder.    

To configure the engine (log level, search and evaluation features and parameters, etc.) a config file can be used. 
Default place to look for it is ./config.toml. Use command line option "-config" to change the location.

Also helpful:
* logs files are stored in folder "../logs" or folder defined by cmd line option "-logpath"
* opening books are searched in folder "../assets/book" or folder defined in cmd line option "-bookpath"

Command line options:
